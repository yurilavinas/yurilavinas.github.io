# First post {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Hello, all. I'm happy to introduce my research blog. This is where I will write about my research projects and other related stuff that I find interesting.

## Living abroad experiences {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Hi, again. This is my second post, and, wow, after a really long time. This time, I'm moving a little away from research topics and I will discuss a little my experiences while living abroad.

## Visualizations {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Hi, again. This is my first blog post. The idea here is to show a little of my research is a different way to the traditional papers that we read. I hope you can enjoy reading it as I did when I wrote this.
