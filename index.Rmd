<div style="width: 65%; float: left;">

I'm an associate professor at the University of Toulouse 1 Capitole, France and I'm on the [REVA team](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-hpc-simulation-optimization/reva-team/). I did a postdoc research working with histopathology image analysis for cancer treatment with Genetic Programming in the [IRIT@CRCT](https://www.crct-inserm.fr/iritcrct/) group. I got my PhD degree from the University of Tsukuba, Japan. Originally, I'm from Brazil, where I did my undergraduate course, at the University of Brasilia. 

My research interests are related to Computational Intelligence, such as Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life, with a greater focus on multi-objective optimization, fitness landscape and  Genetic Programming. Overall, I'm interested in programs that can adapt themselves, in applications of Evolutionary Computation (black box optimization, multi-agent systems, games), as well as more speculative use of these Computational Intelligence for Artificial Life ( such as the evolution of virtual creatures and the worlds where the live).
