  Some additional details about the blog

I’m a postdoc research working with histopathology image analysis for cancer treatment with genetic programming. I was a PhD student at the University of Tsukuba (2020-2023). I graduated in Computer Science (2016) at the University of Brasilia, Brazil, and I got my Master Degree at the University of Tsukuba, Japan (2020). 

I am conducting research since I was an undergraduate student, in Brazil at the University of Brasilia. During that time, I was awarded with two research scholarships. During my undergraduate period I had the chance to pursuit a sandwich program financed by the Brazilian government - Science without Borders - to conduct research in Japan for a year, at the University of Tsukuba. After graduating, I started a master course also at University of Tsukuba, with the MEXT scholarship. Then, I was granted another MEXT scholarship, to continue my studies in Japan, but as a PhD student.
