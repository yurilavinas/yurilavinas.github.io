<!-- # About me -->

### BIO {.tabset .tabset-pills}

I am a PhD student at the University of Tsukuba. I graduated in Computer Science (2016) in the University of Brasilia, Brazil, and I my Master Degree at the University of Tsukuba (2020). 

I am conducting research since I was an undergraduate student, in Brazil at the University of Brasilia. During that time, I was awarded with two research scholarship. During my undergraduate period I had the chance to pursuit a sandwich program financed by the Brazilian government - Science without Borders - to conduct research in Japan for a year. After graduating, I started a master course at the same university. Then, I was granted with the opportunity by MEXT to start a research study in Japan.
